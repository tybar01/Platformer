# Overview

This is a very simple 3D platformer with level transitions and death planes. You enter the game and your goal is to reach 
the white square that will progress you into the next level. If you step on a cobblestone patch you trigger a trap
that will kill your character and you will need to restart

This project was to increase proficiency in unreal engine and its tools. The focus was to build proficieny in
interacting with and using a game engine to impliment features I find fundamental in games currently

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
In this Project i chose Unreal Engine 5. This game framework allows for a very powerful object creator and editer.
The main tool i used was creating actors which can then be used to execute commands during the games runtime. 

In UE 5 i used the blueplrint environment to manage the coding. It is visual based environment with emphasis
on cause and effect, as well as flow of information in real time.
